# About This Project
   I created this project when I was 12 years old, way back in 2013 using Visual C#. I was looking for an alternative to a popular shareware on the internet, they were asking $18 USD, which was a huge amount for me at that time, as I had a pocket money of only $10 USD/month. So, that need pushed me to come up with this.
